<h2 align="center"> 🎯  Additional Information 🎯  </h2>
 
 - Keeping beginners in mind and ensuring that young talented newcomers make notable contributions to their first open-source project, things have been kept simple for now. The project will be made using **HTML**, **CSS** and a modest amount of **JavaScript**.
 
  - lazyCode will be taken a step further after the Hacktoberfest by making it with **React** and adding exciting functionality. For now it will remain centred on creating a simple template which can be cloned and used to update one's own codes.
 
  -  With time and your ample contributions, lazyCode aims to evolve into a *web-app* where everyone can upload their unique codes, share them and discuss about them.
 
   - Here are the  <a href ="https://www.figma.com/file/nhmSygpLCznrCwPBmYEjdK/lazyCode?node-id=0%3A1">designs</a> to get you started on this journey.

#### 🎃 Transpiring from October 1st to 31st, Hacktoberfest is a month-long fiesta sponsored by Digital Ocean and GitHub to give a dive to developers, be it beginners or aces, into the world of open-source contribution.
 
#### 🧑‍💻  Open-source contributions are a great way for developers to improve the software they rely upon, hone technical as well as soft skills and most importantly build experiences and communities that are cherished for a lifetime. 
 
#### 🎯   During the entire month of October 2021, all you have to do is open at least 4 pull requests. Complete the 2021 challenge and earn a limited edition T-shirt.
